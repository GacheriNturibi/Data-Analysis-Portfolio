## Unveiling Insights from Spatial and Demographic Data: My SQL Explorations

Welcome to my collection of SQL queries tackling a spatial and demographic analysis project focused on Kenya's West Pokot County. This code showcases my expertise in leveraging PostGIS for complex data manipulation and analysis.

**Key Tasks:**

* Integrate and analyze census data, school information, and geographic boundaries (sub-counties).
* Identify school distribution, count, and operators within West Pokot.
* Analyze water points, their operators, and proximity to schools.
* Explore sub-county level demographics and spatial details.

**Dive into the Queries:**

* **Census & Sub-counties Integration:** (Queries 1, 5) Establish linkages between demographic data and spatial boundaries, enabling sub-county level analysis.
* **School Distribution and Operators:** (Queries 2, 4, 10) Explore school distribution, count, and identify operators in West Pokot, revealing spatial patterns and management structures.
* **Water Points and Accessibility:** (Queries 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13) Delve into water point locations, operators, and assess their accessibility to schools, providing insights into potential infrastructure disparities.
* **Sub-county Demographics:** (Queries 6, 14) Analyze population distribution (male, female, intersex, total) and spatial characteristics (area) across sub-counties within West Pokot.

**Beyond the Code:**

This collection demonstrates my ability to translate research questions into executable SQL queries and extract meaningful insights from spatial and demographic data.
